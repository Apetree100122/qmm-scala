QMM-SCALA

A scala implementation of the Quine McCluskey method I learned in Advanced Logic Design, and a chance to practice functional programming.

API:

qmm.method(list of minterms, list of don't cares, list of variable names)

TODOS:
  - rewrite genImplicants to be more functional
  - Implement Branching or Petrick's Method for cyclic patterns.
	- Implement optional tabular output
	- Handle special cases better
	- Store implicants more efficiently (bitfield instead of a set)
